# 4)Write a program that depicts the use of (') single quote , (") double quotes and (''' or """) triple quotes (Mandatory)
print('<<<This Print Statement is written in SINGLE quote>>>\n The most common use of single and double quotes is to represent strings by enclosing a series of characters. As shown in the code below, we create these two strings using single and double quotes, respectively.')
print("<<<This Print Statement is written in DOUBLE quote>>>\n As you notice, the strings created by using single and double quotes are the same. In other words, we can use single and double quotes interchangeably when we declare a string. However, it should be noted that we don’t want to mix them as it’s a syntactical error.")
print("""<<<This Print Statement is written in TRIPLE quote>>>\n It should be noted that when a string starts or ends with a single or double quote and we want to use the triple quotes for the string, we need to use the ones that differ from the starting or ending one. For example, for the string in the above code snippet, using triple double quotes would result in a syntactical error. In this case, we want to use the triple single quotes as above.Another use case of the triple quotes is to represent a multi-line string. An example is given below. You can use either triple single or double quotes in this case.)
